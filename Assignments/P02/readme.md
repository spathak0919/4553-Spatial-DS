## No Path Still - Rtree Nearest Neighbor with UFO's

# Program Description
 To Create a fully connected graph between all the cities, without using roads, and simply connecting each city "as the crow flies" using straight lines. We were also going to use   UFO sightings as a metric for which cities to visit. Basically visit cities with lots of UFO sightings before visiting cities that had fewer UFO sightings.
